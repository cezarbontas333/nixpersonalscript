# nixpersonalscript
Personal NixOS script for configuring my system.

### System configuration
System has:
- CPU: i7 4790
- RAM: 16GB DDR3 1600MHz
- Platform: H97 Asus ROG G20AJ
- Storage:
  - Kingston A400 960GB
  - Toshiba DT01ACA100 1TB
- GPU: Lenovo GTX 1070

### Additional notes
Learned quite a bit from using and searching how NixOS works, but some packages from what I would have liked to use are missing and having them compiled would have missed the point of managing a nix instance. This is mostly for archival reasons but I might go back to this setup in the future.
